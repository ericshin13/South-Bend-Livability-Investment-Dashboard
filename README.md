# South-Bend-Livability-Investment-Dashboard

This project explored data-driven opportunities to improve urban livability and guide strategic investment in South Bend. Our team designed and built an interactive Shiny dashboard to support municipal decision-making aligned with the policy priorities of James Mueller, who was elected Mayor of South Bend in 2020 and re-elected in 2024. The dashboard integrates geospatial and demographic data to evaluate neighborhood livability, analyze relationships between street lighting and crime, track trends in abandoned properties relative to community resources, and assess school-zone demographics to identify areas where support for underprivileged children may have the greatest impact. Through clear, accessible visualizations, the project translated complex city data into actionable insights for public safety, education, and economic development planning.
